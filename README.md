Project Goal:
The goal of the project is to implement a program that will monitor DNS communication
on a selected interface or from an existing record in PCAP format.
The tool processes DNS messages and lists the information found.
In addition, it allows you to find out what domain names appeared in the messages
and search for translations of domain names to IPv4/6 addresses.
